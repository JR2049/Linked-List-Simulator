# 🧩 Linked List Simulator (Python)

This project is a **class-based implementation of a singly linked list** in Python.  
It demonstrates how to build and manipulate a linked data structure using **object-oriented programming**.

---

## ✨ Features

The `SLinkedList` class supports the following operations:

- Add nodes to the list
- Insert nodes at specific positions
- Delete nodes
- Swap the position of two nodes
- Reverse the list
- Apply sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Print the current state of the list

The underlying list is built from `Node` objects, which store values and references to the next node.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`Node` class** → Defines the structure of a node (`data`, `pointer`)  
- **`SLinkedList` class** → Defines the head node of the linked list and the list's operations  
- **Test code (at the bottom)** → Demonstrates the linked list methods in action  

> ⚠️ There is no GUI or command-line interface. To experiment, edit the **test code** section at the bottom of the file.
